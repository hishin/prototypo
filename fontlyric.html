    Fun: We Are Young
</h1>
<p>
    Give me a second I,</br>
    I need to get my story straight</br>
    My friends are in the bathroom getting higher than the Empire State</br>
    My lover she's waiting for me just across the bar</br>
    My seat's been taken by some sunglasses asking about a scar, and</br>
    I know I gave it to you months ago</br>
    I know you're trying to forget</br>
    But between the drinks and subtle things</br>
    The holes in my apologies, you know</br>
    I'm trying hard to take it back</br>
    So if by the time the bar closes</br>
    And you feel like falling down, I'll carry you home</br>
</p>
<p>
    Tonight, we are young</br>
    So let's set the world on fire</br>
    We can burn brighter than the sun</br>
</p>
<p>
    Tonight, we are young</br>
    So let's set the world on fire</br>
    We can burn brighter than the sun</br>
</p>
<p>
    Now I know that I'm not</br>
    All that you got, I guess that I, I just thought</br>
    Maybe we could find new ways to fall apart</br>
    But our friends are back</br>
    So let's raise a tab</br>
    'Cause I found someone to carry me home</br>
</p>
<p>
    Tonight, we are young</br>
    So let's set the world on fire</br>
    We can burn brighter than the sun</br>
</p>
<p>
    Tonight, we are young</br>
    So let's set the world on fire</br>
    We can burn brighter than the sun</br>
</p>
<p>
    Carry me home tonight (Na na na na na na)</br>
    Just carry me home tonight (Na na na na na na)</br>
    Carry me home tonight (Na na na na na na)</br>
    Just carry me home tonight (Na na na na na na)</br>
</p>
<p>
    The world is on my side</br>
    I have no reason to run</br>
    So will someone come and carry me home tonight</br>
    The angels never arrived</br>
    But I can hear the choir</br>
    So will someone come and carry me home</br>
</p>
<p>
    Tonight, we are young</br>
    So let's set the world on fire</br>
    We can burn brighter than the sun</br>
</p>
<p>

    And you feel like falling down</br>
