0
00:00:08,612 --> 00:00:10,011
Give me a second I,

1
00:00:10,213 --> 00:00:12,212
I need to get my story straight

2
00:00:12,418 --> 00:00:13,917
My friends are in the bathroom

3
00:00:14,109 --> 00:00:16,208
Getting higher than the Empire State

4
00:00:16,416 --> 00:00:18,315
My lover she's waiting for me

5
00:00:18,517 --> 00:00:19,916
Just across the bar

6
00:00:20,110 --> 00:00:22,409
My seat's been taken by some sunglasses

7
00:00:22,605 --> 00:00:24,604
Asking about a scar and...

8
00:00:24,814 --> 00:00:29,013
I know I gave it to you months ago

9
00:00:29,207 --> 00:00:32,306
I know you're trying to forget

10
00:00:32,512 --> 00:00:34,811
But between the drinks and saddle things

11
00:00:35,011 --> 00:00:36,910
The holes in my apologies

12
00:00:37,102 --> 00:00:40,501
You know, I'm trying hard to
take it back

13
00:00:40,707 --> 00:00:43,406
So if by the time the bar closes

14
00:00:43,616 --> 00:00:46,215
And you feel like falling down

15
00:00:46,415 --> 00:00:48,914
I'll carry you home

16
00:00:49,102 --> 00:00:53,501
Tonight,

17
00:00:53,709 --> 00:00:57,408
We are young;

18
00:00:57,606 --> 00:01:01,605
So let's set the world on fire,

19
00:01:01,799 --> 00:01:03,898
we can burn brighter,

20
00:01:04,106 --> 00:01:09,805
Than the sun

21
00:01:10,017 --> 00:01:14,016
Tonight

22
00:01:14,216 --> 00:01:18,415
We are young

23
00:01:18,609 --> 00:01:22,208
So let's set the world on fire

24
00:01:22,404 --> 00:01:24,703
We can burn brighter,

25
00:01:24,907 --> 00:01:30,406
Than the sun

26
00:01:30,610 --> 00:01:33,009
Now I know that I'm not

27
00:01:33,213 --> 00:01:35,812
All that you got

28
00:01:36,008 --> 00:01:37,007
I guess that I

29
00:01:37,103 --> 00:01:41,102
I just thought maybe we could
find new ways to fall apart

30
00:01:41,314 --> 00:01:44,213
But our friends are back

31
00:01:44,411 --> 00:01:46,510
So let's raise a cup

32
00:01:46,716 --> 00:01:50,915
Cause I found someone to carry me home

33
00:01:51,103 --> 00:01:55,102
Tonight

34
00:01:55,308 --> 00:01:59,307
We are young

35
00:01:59,507 --> 00:02:03,106
So let's the set the world on fire

36
00:02:03,302 --> 00:02:05,601
We can burn brighter

37
00:02:05,807 --> 00:02:11,606
Than the sun

38
00:02:11,802 --> 00:02:15,801
Tonight

39
00:02:16,003 --> 00:02:20,202
We are young

40
00:02:20,404 --> 00:02:23,903
So let's set the world on fire

41
00:02:24,119 --> 00:02:26,718
We can burn brighter

42
00:02:26,906 --> 00:02:32,505
Than the sun

43
00:02:32,713 --> 00:02:37,712
Carry me home tonight

44
00:02:37,902 --> 00:02:42,901
Just carry me home tonight

45
00:02:43,101 --> 00:02:48,100
Carry me home tonight

46
00:02:48,314 --> 00:02:53,413
Just carry me home tonight

47
00:02:53,607 --> 00:02:57,306
The world is on my side (
)

48
00:02:57,514 --> 00:02:59,513
I have no reason to run (
(

49
00:02:59,719 --> 00:03:04,918
So will someone come and carry
me home tonight

50
00:03:05,102 --> 00:03:07,501
The angels never arrived(

51
00:03:07,701 --> 00:03:09,900
But I can hear the choir (
n)

52
00:03:10,102 --> 00:03:14,301
So will someone come and carry
me home

53
00:03:14,503 --> 00:03:18,202
Tonight

54
00:03:18,410 --> 00:03:22,809

So let's set the world on fire

56
00:03:26,716 --> 00:03:29,015

57
00:03:29,209 --> 00:03:35,008
Than the sun

58
00:03:35,204 --> 00:03:39,303
Tonight

59
00:03:39,509 --> 00:03:43,708
