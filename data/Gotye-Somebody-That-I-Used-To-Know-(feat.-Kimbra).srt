00:00:19,316 --> 00:00:25,615
Now and then I think of when
we were together

1
00:00:25,805 --> 00:00:33,104
Like when you said you felt so
happy you could die

2
00:00:33,304 --> 00:00:37,203
Told myself that you were right for me

3
00:00:37,417 --> 00:00:40,816
But felt so lonely in your company

4
00:00:41,018 --> 00:00:49,017
But that was love and it's an
ache I still remember

5
00:01:03,407 --> 00:01:10,406
You can get addicted to a
certain kind of sadness

6
00:01:10,604 --> 00:01:18,103
Like resignation to the end,
always the end

7
00:01:18,303 --> 00:01:21,902
So when we found that we could
not make sense

8
00:01:22,106 --> 00:01:25,605
Well you said that we would
still be friends

9
00:01:25,817 --> 00:01:33,016
But I'll admit that I was glad
that it was over

10
00:01:33,214 --> 00:01:37,213
But you didn't have to cut me off

11
00:01:37,419 --> 00:01:41,418
Make out like it never
happened and that we were
nothing

12
00:01:41,612 --> 00:01:43,711
And I don't even need your love

13
00:01:43,909 --> 00:01:48,408
But you treat me like a
stranger and that feels so
rough

14
00:01:48,610 --> 00:01:51,709
No you didn't have to stoop so low

15
00:01:51,909 --> 00:01:55,808
Have your friends collect your
records and then change your
number

16
00:01:56,010 --> 00:01:58,709
I guess that I don't need that though

17
00:01:58,901 --> 00:02:06,400
Now you're just somebody that
I used to know

18
00:02:06,618 --> 00:02:13,617
Now you're just somebody that
I used to know

19
00:02:13,807 --> 00:02:21,806
Now you're just somebody that
I used to know

20
00:02:33,118 --> 00:02:39,817
Now and then I think of all
the times you screwed me over

21
00:02:40,001 --> 00:02:47,900
But had me believing it was
always something that I'd done

22
00:02:48,104 --> 00:02:51,303
But I don't wanna live that way

23
00:02:51,511 --> 00:02:55,410
Reading into every word you say

24
00:02:55,618 --> 00:02:58,217
You said that you could let it go

25
00:02:58,405 --> 00:03:02,804
And I wouldn't catch you hung
up on somebody that you used
to know

26
00:03:03,014 --> 00:03:06,413
But you didn't have to cut me off

27
00:03:06,611 --> 00:03:10,510
Make out like it never
happened and that we were
nothing

28
00:03:10,712 --> 00:03:13,011
And I don't even need your love

29
00:03:13,217 --> 00:03:17,216
But you treat me like a
stranger and that feels so
rough

30
00:03:17,414 --> 00:03:20,713
No you didn't have to stoop so low

31
00:03:20,901 --> 00:03:25,100
Have your friends collect your
records and then change your
number

32
00:03:25,308 --> 00:03:27,907
I guess that I don't need that though

33
00:03:28,107 --> 00:03:31,506
Now you're just somebody that
I used to know

34
00:03:31,716 --> 00:03:33,515
Somebody

35
00:03:33,717 --> 00:03:35,016
(I used to know)

36
00:03:35,214 --> 00:03:36,613
Somebody

37
00:03:36,811 --> 00:03:38,810
(Now you're just somebody that
I used to know)

38
00:03:39,018 --> 00:03:41,017
Somebody

39
00:03:41,215 --> 00:03:42,514
(I used to know)

40
00:03:42,706 --> 00:03:44,005
Somebody

41
00:03:44,203 --> 00:03:48,402
(Now you're just somebody that
I used to know)

42
00:03:48,604 --> 00:03:51,903
(I used to know)

43
00:03:52,117 --> 00:03:55,616
(That I used to know)

44
00:03:55,804 --> 00:03:57,503
(I used to know)

45
00:03:57,711 --> 00:04:02,710
Somebody

46
00:04:03,712 --> 00:04:12,711
